# eleventy-dot-js-blog

A starter repository showing how to build a blog with the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) static site generator using [JavaScript templates (`*.11ty.js`)](https://11ty.dev/languages/javascript/).

## Summary

This site includes prerendered static files generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) (11ty).

The templates are written entirely in vanilla JavaScript (files with the [`*.11ty.js`](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/javascript/) extension).

## Local development

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine (see [11ty documentation for specific requirements](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/)).

Then enter the following commands into your terminal:

### Getting started

#### 1. Clone this repository and all its dependencies.

```cli
git clone git@gitlab.com:reubenlillie/eleventy-dot-js-blog.git my-blog-directory-name
```

#### 2. Go to the working directory.

```cli
cd my-blog-directory-name
```

#### 3. Install the project dependencies with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
npm install
```

#### 4. Start your local server.

```cli
npm run dev
```

## Publish your own copy

The command `npm run build` will generate a copy of the site files in a `_site` directory, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
