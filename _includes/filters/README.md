# eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes/filters

In Eleventy, [filters](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/) can modify content before templates are processed. They are accessible in templates via the keyword `this`.

The `index.js` file here is used to configure filters in this directory with Eleventy (in `.eleventy.js`, loaded in `eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes/index.js`).
