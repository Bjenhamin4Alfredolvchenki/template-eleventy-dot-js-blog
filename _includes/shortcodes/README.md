# eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes/shortcodes

In Eleventy, [shortcodes](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/) can be used to modify content. They are accessible in templates via the keyword `this`.

The `index.js` file here is used to configure shortcodes in this directory with Eleventy (in `.eleventy.js`, loaded in `eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes/index.js`).
