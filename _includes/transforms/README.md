# eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes/transforms

In Eleventy, [transforms](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#transforms) can modify content after templates have been processed. Whereas [filters](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/) have to be called explicitly within other files, transforms run automatically.

The `index.js` file here is used to configure transforms in this directory with Eleventy (in `.eleventy.js`, loaded in `eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes/index.js`).
