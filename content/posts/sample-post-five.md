Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? The Federation’s gone; the Borg is everywhere! And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. What? We’re not at all alike! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I recommend you don’t fire until you’re within 40,000 kilometers. I’m afraid I still don’t understand, sir.

The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Worf, It’s better than music. It’s jazz. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Wouldn’t that bring about chaos? We know you’re dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I’ll alert the crew.
