I’d like to think that I haven’t changed those things, sir. I think you’ve let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I’ll be sure to note that in my log. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?

Your head is not an artifact! Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Not if I weaken first. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Shields up! Rrrrred alert!
