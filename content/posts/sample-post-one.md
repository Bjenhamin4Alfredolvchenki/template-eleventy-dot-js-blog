We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I am your worst nightmare! I’m afraid I still don’t understand, sir. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. They were just sucked into space. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.

Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who’s asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Your head is not an artifact!
