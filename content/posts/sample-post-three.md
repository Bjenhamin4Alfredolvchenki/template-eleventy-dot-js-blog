Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I’m afraid I still don’t understand, sir. Besides, you look good in a dress. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. and attack the Romulans. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who’s asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Sorry, Data. I am your worst nightmare!

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. We know you’re dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. We have a saboteur aboard. Wait a minute—you’ve been declared dead. You can’t give orders around here. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I can’t. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches &hellip; and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?
